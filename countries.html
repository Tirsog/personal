<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in Afghanistan</h2>

<p>In Afghanistan, trademark registration is mandatory to be granted rights over a trademark, as it is a "first to file" jurisdiction. Only in some exceptional cases can an unregistered trademark be protected. The trademark applications must be filed with the Afghanistan Central Business Registry (<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="http://www.acbr.gov.af/" target="_blank" title="Afghanistan trademarks office">ACBR</a>).</p>

<p>Trademarks cannot be registered for alcoholic beverages.</p>

<p>If you register a combined trademark (which includes both word elements and figurative elements) in Afghanistan, the exclusive right to use the trademark is limited to a use of the trademark in the exact configuration or way in which it was filed and registered. If you wish to use the word element of your trademark separately from the logo (or vice versa), it is recommended you register for another trademark including only the word or figurative elements you wish to use and protect separately.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if a third party eventually intends to register or use a trademark for similar goods or services that includes a primary or distinct part or portion of your trademark, you will have the right to oppose the application based on confusing similarity.</p>

<p>Opposition actions may be filed by interested third parties against a trademark application within a period of one (1) month following its publication in the Official Gazette of Afghanistan. It is also possible to present post-registration oppositions within 12 months from the date of registration. The probabilities of success for an opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>Although a trademark does not have to be in use in order for it to register, it must not go unused for periods of three years or it will become vulnerable to cancellation actions based on lack of use of the trademark.</p>

<p>Registered trademarks in Afghanistan have a validity of ten (10) years from the application date and can be renewed indefinitely for further periods of ten (10) years. After the trademark has expired, there is a grace period of six (6) months during which the trademark can still be renewed, upon payment of a late renewal fee.</p>

<p>For trademark assessment reports the trademark must be in Latin alphabet and will only consider other trademarks in Latin alphabet. If you wish for a study for a trademark written in the local writing system (Pashto) and that includes results of trademarks in the local alphabet (Pashto), please contact us. Additional fees will apply.</p>

<p>If you would like for the figurative or design elements of your trademark to be considered when assessing your trademark for registration in Afghanistan (Trademark Search Report), contact us directly in order to determine if we may be able to offer this in this jurisdiction. In such cases, prices for service and estimated delivery times may vary.</p>

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in Australia</h2>

<p>In Australia registration is not mandatory to obtain trademark rights. Extensive prior use of a trademark will have legal recognition and may allow the owner to claim certain rights.</p>

<p>Registering a trade mark in Australia is highly recommended. A trademark that is registered through the Australian trademark office will safeguard the owner’s rights.</p>

<p>Having a registered trademark in Australia will grant presumption of ownership. Having your trademark registered in Australia will prove useful in case of cases of unauthorized use of trademark infringement.</p>

<p>Registered trademarks in Australia may use the registration symbol ®. This may only be done in connection to the goods or services included in the trademark registration.</p>

<p>The TM symbol may be used in connection to a trademark being used in Australia that is still not registered. This is used to alert third parties that the mark is in fact being used as a trademark.</p>

<p>The government authority in charge of trademarks is called the <a href="https://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/trade-marks" target="_blank" title="Australian trademark office">Australian Intellectual Property Office (IP Australia)</a>. This government office is not only responsible for trademarks but also for other areas of intellectual property IP as well.</p>

<p>Trade mark registration in Australia automatically grants protection in the Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Nauru and Norfolk Island.</p>

<p>Australian trademark system came into effect with Australia’s Trade Marks Act 1905. The very first trademark to ever be registered in Australia was PEPS. This trademark was registered as a medical product to deal with colds.</p>

<p>Currently there are more than 1 million registered marks. The current trademark legislation in Australia is the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2020C00103" target="_blank" title="Australian trade marks act of 1995">Trade Marks Act of 1995</a>.</p>

<h2>Trademark search in Australia</h2>

<p>The trademark data base in Australia is available online and keeps records of all Australian trade marks that have been filed.</p>

<p>The Australian trademark database works very well to find possible identical or similar trademarks. The fact that similar trademarks do not exist in Australia does not ensure successful registration. A full Australian trade mark search report should be carried out by a trademark attorney before you proceed.</p>

<p>In Australia the trademark office search will use the Australia trademark database that is available to the public. However when examining a trademark not only will similarity between trademarks be considered to decide if it is registrable.</p>

<p>Numerous <a href="https://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/sct/en/comments/pdf/sct21/ref_australia.pdf" target="_blank" title="Australian TM grounds for refusal">grounds for refusing a trademark in Australia</a> will be examined by the registration authority. &nbsp;Many of the reasons for which a trademark will be refused are also applied in other countries. However, Australia does have some unique reasons for refusing a trademark application.</p>

<p>Generally last names or surnames can be registered as trademarks in other countries. In Australia a trademark that includes a surname will be refused if it is considered common by the trademarks office. Surnames will be deemed common for trademark purposes if they appear more than 750 times in the <a href="https://www.nla.gov.au/research-guides/australian-electoral-rolls" target="_blank" title="Australian electoral roll">Australian electoral roll</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>iGERENT offers extensive search services. Our search reports will allow you to identify any possible issues a trademark application may face before filing for it. Our reports are done by trademark attorneys.</p>

<p>Our australian trademark experts do not only carry out an Australian TM search. Our experts will also take into account possible grounds for refusal. Our examination is carried out in the same way the trademark authority will do so when examining your application.</p>

<h2>Australian trademark registration process</h2>

<p>An Australian trademark can be registered for a business name, product name, catch phrase, logo, color, shape or even a scent.</p>

<p>In Australia it is generally irrelevant if you file a trademark in color or in black and white. Trademark owners will have the right to use their marks in any combination of colors they see fit. Exceptional restrictions exist if colors of the trademark are specifically stated at the moment of filing the trademark application.</p>

<p>No power of attorney documents are necessary in order to proceed with a trademark application in Australia. Foreign applicants will need to be represented by a local trademark agent.</p>

<p>Trademarks are filed directly through the government office of intellectual property of Australia. Filing of a trademark application for Australia is also possible as an <a href="https://igerent.com/madrid-system-trademark-registration" title="International trademark iGERENT">international trademark through the Madrid System</a>. This is possible as <a href="https://www.wipo.int/madrid/en/members/" target="_blank" title="Madrid member country list">Australia is a member of the Madrid Protocol</a>.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to use a trademark for its products and services before filing or during the application process.</p>

<p>Once a trademark is filed it will undergo an in depth examination by the Australian trademark authority.</p>

<p>If a filed trademark includes words that are not in English translation of the words will need to be accompanied. If a trademark consists of words in foreign characters a transliteration and translation of the words will need to be presented.</p>

<p>The examination process is not limited to checking to see if prior similar trademarks exist. Numerous other causes for refusing a trademark exist. If a trademark is initially refused by the trademark office, depending on the reasons for refusal this may be overcome.</p>

<p>Effective use of the trademark may prove useful. This is specially true when an adverse report is received for the grounds of lack of distinctiveness. Distinctiveness of a trademark may be acquired in Australia through prior use.</p>

<p>Once a mark successfully passes the examination stage it will be published in the <a href="https://search.ipaustralia.gov.au/trademarks/journals" target="_blank" title="Australian trademark journal">Australian official journal of trade marks</a>.</p>

<p>Once a trademark is published in the trade mark journal there is a 2 month period to oppose the trademark. Trademark opposition periods allow for third parties to prevent the registration of a mark that they believe affect their trademark rights. Chances of success for an opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>Once the trademark is successfully registered, the Australian Intellectual Property Office will send a trademark certificate of registration in digital format.</p>

<h2>Keeping your Australian trademark live after registration</h2>

<p>A registered trademark in Australia is valid for 10 years. The 10 year period is counted from the application date.</p>

<p>Not using your registered trademark in Australia after registration may lead to its cancellation. Cancellation actions may be presented against a trademark that is not used within the first 5 years after its registration. After this trademark cancellation actions may still be received if the mark is not used for more than 3 years.</p>

<p>Trademarks may be renewed in Australia every ten years as many times as needed.</p>

<p>Trademark renewal in Australia needs to be processed the year preceding to the expiration date. There is also a period for Australian trademark renewal after it expires. The late renewal period is for 6 months and is available upon payment of additional fees.</p>

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in Austria</h2>

<p>To obtain trademark protection in Austria, one can register either locally via the Österreichische Patentamt (<a href="http://www.patentamt.at/" target="_blank" title="Austria trademarks office">ÖPA</a>), or regionally by filing a&nbsp;<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademark-registration-european-union" title="EU trademark services">European Union Trademarks (EUTM)</a>.</p>

<p>Austria is also a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/treaties/en/documents/pdf/madrid_marks.pdf" target="_blank" title="Madrid Member States">member state</a>&nbsp;to the Madrid Protocol. Thus, the extension of an international registration of a trademark via the Madrid System is possible for this country. For further information regarding our services for trademark filing through the Madrid System&nbsp;<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/madrid-system-trademark-registration" title="Madrid trademark services">click here</a>.</p>

<p>Austria is a “first-to-file” jurisdiction, which means that except in some specific cases, the rights to a trademark are granted to the first person to file it, not the first person to use it. Use of the trademark before registration is not necessary and will not help overcome objections raised on grounds of lack of distinctiveness.</p>

<p>Although it is not necessary to use the trademark for it to register, it must be used within a period of five (5) years since the last use, otherwise it will become vulnerable to cancellation for non-use. The amount of use in Austria must be on a commercial scale.</p>

<p>The Austrian trademarks office (ÖPA) will examine the application to check whether the trademark complies with the requirements for registration. Once the application is accepted for registration, the grant of registration will be published, marking the beginning of a three-month period during which third parties can file an opposition against it.</p>

<p>Austrian trademarks are valid for ten (10) years from the application date. The renewal can be applied as early as one year before the expiry date until the last day of the month of the renewal date. There is a grace period of 6 (six) months after the expiry date when the trademark can still be renewed provided a late renewal fee is paid.</p>

<p>If you register a combined trademark (which includes both word elements and figurative elements) in Austria, the exclusive right to use the trademark is limited to a use of the trademark is limited to a use of the trademark in the exact configuration or way in which it was filed and registered. If you wish to use the word element of your trademark separately from the logo (or vice versa), it is recommended you register for another trademark including only the word or figurative elements you wish to use and protect separately.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if a third party eventually intends to register or use a trademark for similar goods or services that includes a primary or distinct part or portion of your trademark, you will have the right to oppose the application based on confusing similarity. Probabilities of success for an opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.</p>

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in Azerbaijan</h2>

<p>In Azerbaijan, trademark registration is mandatory to be granted rights over a trademark, as it is a "first to file" jurisdiction. Only in some exceptional cases can an unregistered trademark be protected. The trademark applications must be filed with the Industrial Property Office of the Republic of Azerbaijan (<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="http://www.copag.gov.az/copag/en" target="_blank" title="Azerbaijan trademarks office">AZSTAND</a>).</p>

<p>Azerbaijan is also a&nbsp;<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/treaties/en/documents/pdf/madrid_marks.pdf" target="_blank" title="Madrid Member States">member state</a>&nbsp;to the Madrid Protocol.

<p>Trademarks in Azerbaijan grant protection in Nagorno-Karabakh. However, this territory is disputed and owners of a registered trademark in Azerbaijan may have difficulties enforcing their rights.</p>

<p>If you register a combined trademark (which includes both word elements and figurative elements) in Azerbaijan, the exclusive right to use the trademark is limited to a use of the trademark in the exact configuration or way in which it was filed and registered. If you wish to use the word element of your trademark separately from the logo (or vice versa), it is recommended you register for another trademark including only the word or figurative elements you wish to use and protect separately.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if a third party eventually intends to register or use a trademark for similar goods or services that includes a primary or distinct part or portion of your trademark, you will have the right to pursue legal remedies against it.</p>

<p>During the examination stage of a local trademark application, interested third parties may file non-official opposition actions against it, consisting of a written communication to the trademarks office presenting arguments against its registration. In the case of a trademark filed through the Madrid system, such actions may be taken within 12 months after the publication in the WIPO gazette.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once the trademark is registered, cancellation actions may also be filed based on prior rights within five (5) years after the registration. The probabilities of success for such actions will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although a trademark does not have to be in use in order for it to register, it must not go unused for longer than five years once it is registered or it will become vulnerable to cancellation actions based on lack of use of the trademark.</p>

<p>Registered trademarks in Azerbaijan have a validity of ten (10) years from the application date and can be renewed indefinitely for further periods of ten (10) years. There is a grace period of six (6) months after the expiration date during which the trademark renewal may still be requested upon payment of a late renewal additional fee.</p>

<p>Registered trademarks in Benelux have a validity of ten (10) years from the date of application. It can then be renewed for successive periods of ten years indefinitely.

<h2>Why and how to register a trademark in Benin</h2>

<h3>What should I know before applying for a trademark in Benin?</h3>

<p>Before you learn how to register a trademark in Benin, this is what you should know.</p>

<p>In Benin, trademarks are governed by the Bangui Agreement, dating back from 1977, which establishes trademark law for all its signatory countries; this means that Benin does not have its own trademark regulations and trademark protection is dictated by this agreement. This means that all trademarks in Benin are <a href="https://igerent.com/trademark/africa/trademark-registration-oapi">registered through the OAPI</a> (in French, <a href="http://www.oapi.int/">Organisation Africaine de la Propriété Intellectuelle</a>; in English, African Intellectual Property Organization). Benin does have a local bureau in Cotonou, the Agence nationale de la propriété Industrielle (ANaPI), but it is only for citizens or residents of Benin, not foreign registrants, and does not process trademark applications but rather dispatches them to OAPI.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since OAPI is a member of the <a href="https://igerent.com/madrid-protocol-trademark-registration">Madrid system</a>, by extension Benin is as well. Therefore, foreign trademark owners from Madrid system member country can chose to extend their trademark to OAPI via the <a href="https://www.wipo.int/portal/en/">World Intellectual Property Organization</a> instead of filing an application with the OAPI.</p>

<p>Once a trademark is registered with the OAPI, its protection covers all of its member countries in addition to Benin: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire), Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal and Togo.</p>

<p>Contrary to other systems such as <a href="https://igerent.com/trademark/africa/trademark-registration-aripo">ARIPO</a>, with the OAPI trademark registration it is not possible to designate fewer member countries or exclude a country: the protection always extend to all current members.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Benin is a first-to-file jurisdiction. This means a trademark is only granted protection once it is registered. Only in the case of globally recognized trademarks can a brand be protected without registration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Benin marks for goods and service marks are considered separate; even if the same trademark will be used for both goods and services, two separate applications will have to be filed, one for the goods (Nice classes 1 through 34) and one for the services (Nice classes 35 thorugh 45).&nbsp;</p>

<p>When colors are to be claimed as a feature of the mark, additional charges will apply.</p>

<p>What are the requirements for trademark registration in Benin?</p>

<p>In order to file an application with the OAPI, a simply signed, original Power of Attorney must be forwarded to the local agent. The form will be provided. It is not necessary to have the Power of Attorney signed before a Notary.</p>

<h3>What is the trademark registration process in Benin?</h3>

<p>The registration process with OAPI from the filing of the application to the issuing of the trademark certificate takes about 6 to 12 months.</p>

<p>Here is a general outline of the process for how to register a trademark in Benin:</p>
<img alt="Trademark registration process in OAPI" data-align="center" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="7bc70137-97cf-46e1-88af-b3996d9d84e4" src="/sites/default/files/inline-images/Diagrama%20de%20proceso_POST%20PUBLICACI%C3%93N_INGL%C3%89S_0.png" />
<p>During the examination process, the trademarks office only considers formal criteria when determining if a trademark is suitable for registration; it does not consider previous similar or identical trademarks. If the trademark complies with the formal requirements, then the certificate of registration will be issued.</p>

<p>After the registration has been granted, and the certificate issued, the registration will be published in the trademarks gazette and interested third-parties will have a period of 6 months in which they are able to file opposition actions against the trademark. If such actions are successfull, the registration will be cancelled.</p>

<p>As soon as the registration has been granted, OAPI will issue a paper trademark certificate. Since the opposition period takes place after the registration certificate has been issued, it must be noted that in case of opposition actions, a trademark for which a certificate has been issued can be rendered invalid.</p>

<h3>What happens once my trademark is registered in Benin?</h3>

<p>All trademarks registered with the OAPI, and therefore in Benin, have an initial validity of 10 years from their date of registration, and can then be renewed for further periods of ten years. There is no limit to how many times a trademark could be registered. If a trademark is not renewed before its expiration date, it will still be possible to request the renewal during the 6 months following it, subject to the payment of increased renewal fees.</p>

<p>A trademark that is not used for more than five years after its registration date will be vulnerable in case a third party wishes to file cancellation actions against it. Using the trademark in one single country that is a signatory of the Bangui agreement is sufficient to prevent this vulnerability.</p>

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in Bermuda</h2>

<p>An unregistered trademark may be protected in Bermuda if long and extensive use of it in Bermuda can be established. However, it is highly recommended a trademark be registered in order to demonstrate ownership. It will be a lot easier and cheaper to stop infringement of one’s trademark if it is registered. Trademarks in Bermuda are registered through the <a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://www.gov.bm/online-services/register-trade-mark" target="_blank" title="Bermuda trademarks office">Registrar General</a> of Bermuda.</p>

<p>If you register a combined trademark (which includes both word elements and figurative elements)&nbsp;in Bermuda, the exclusive right to use the trademark is limited to a use of the trademark in the exact configuration or way in which it was filed and registered. If you wish to use the word element of your trademark separately from the logo (or vice versa), it is recommended you register for another trademark including only the word or figurative elements you wish to use and protect separately.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if a third party eventually intends to register or use a trademark for similar goods or services that includes a primary or distinct part or portion of your trademark, you will have the right to oppose the application based on confusing similarity. Probabilities of success for an opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>Once the trademark has been examined by the trademark office, it will then be published in the Royal Gazette for 2 months, during which time opposition actions may be presented by third parties.</p>

<p>A registered trademark in Bermuda will be granted protection for an initial period of seven (7) years, term that will be counted from the date on which it is successfully registered. A trademark can then be renewed for subsequent periods of 14 years. If a trademark is not renewed before its expiration date, the renewal may still be requesting during a six-month grace period. However, additional late fees would have to be paid.</p>

<p>Although prior use of a trademark is not necessary in order to file or register a trademark in Bermuda, nor is it necessary to demonstrate use to renew it, once registered, if it is not used for a period of five (5) years, third parties may present cancellation actions against the registered trademark.</p>

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in Bolivia</h2>

<p>In Bolivia, trademark rights come into existence upon successful registration. Actual use of a trademark does not grant any rights.</p>

<p>The registration of trademarks in Bolivia is done through the offices of the National Service of Intellectual Property (<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="http://www.senapi.gob.bo/index.asp?lang=EN" target="_blank" title="Bolivia trademarks office">SENAPI</a>).</p>

<p>If you register a combined trademark (which includes both word elements and figurative elements) in Bolivia, the exclusive right to use the trademark is limited to a use of the trademark in the exact configuration or way in which it was filed and registered. If you wish to use the word element of your trademark separately from the logo (or vice versa), it is recommended you register for another trademark including only the word or figurative elements you wish to use and protect separately.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if a third party eventually intends to register or use a trademark for similar goods or services that includes a primary or distinct part or portion of your trademark, you will have the right to oppose the application based on confusing similarity. Opposition actions in this case must be presented within thirty (30) days from the date on which the conflicting trademark application is published for registration. The period of thirty (30) days is of administrative days. Therefore, the timeframe is somewhat longer than thirty (30) calendar days. Probabilities of success for an opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.</p>

In such cases, prices for service and estimated delivery times may vary.</p>

<p>Although it is not required to present proof or statements that a trademark is being used for it to be granted registration, lack of actual use of a trademark may give way for third parties to present cancellation actions against a registered trademark. In order to avoid any possibility of this happening, a trademark should not go unused for periods of more than three (3) years. Bolivia is a member state of the Andean Pact (<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="http://www.comunidadandina.org/Seccion.aspx?id=83&amp;tipo=TE&amp;title=propiedad-intelectual" target="_blank" title="Andean Pact">CAN</a>), therefore, use of a trademark in order to prevent such actions may be done in any of the other member countries (<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademark-registration-colombia" title="Colombia trademark registration information">Colombia</a>, <a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademark-registration-ecuador" title="Ecuador trademark registration information">Ecuador</a> or <a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademark-registration-peru" title="Peru trademark registration information">Peru</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Registered trademarks in Bolivia are granted protection for a period of ten (10) years, term that begins from the date in which they are registered. A trademark can be renewed for subsequent ten-year periods indefinitely. In order to renew a request must be made within the six (6) months preceding its expiry date. In Bolivia, trademarks may still be renewed even once the validity period has lapsed, during a grace period of six (6) months after the trademark’s expiry period.</p>

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in Brazil</h2>

<p>As a general rule, trademark rights in Brazil are only recognized for trademarks that have been registered before the Brazilian National Institute of Industrial Property (<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="http://www.inpi.gov.br/" target="_blank" title="Brazil trademarks office">INPI</a>). However, in exceptional cases, unregistered famous or well-known trademarks may be recognized and protected. Furthermore, if a trademark has been in use in Brazil, opposition actions may be presented against the application of a third parties identical or considerably similar trademark.</p>

<p>In order to register a trademark through the electronic filing system of the Brazilian trademark office, the description of goods or services included in the application must be identical to those available in the 10th edition of the Nice Classification. Filing a trademark electronically will allow the trademark process to move along faster than those of applications filed manually. Please be advised that the registration process in Brazil is quite slow and takes approximately three (3) years from filing to actual registration.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in Brunei</h2>

<p>The rights to a trademark in Brunei are granted to the person or company that first uses it in this territory. Although registration is not mandatory, in practice it is highly recommended in order to demonstrate clear ownership, prevent future conflicts regarding ownership of the trademark and in order to defend against cases of trademark infringement.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for a trademark to be in use in Brunei in order for it to register. Prior use of the trademark can nevertheless be helpful in order to overcome an objection on the grounds of lack of distinctiveness.</p>

<p>In Brunei, trademark applications must be filed with the Brunei Intellectual Property Office (<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="http://www.bruipo.com.bn/" target="_blank" title="Brunei trademarks office">BruIPO</a>).</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if a third party eventually intends to register or use a trademark for similar goods or services that includes a primary or distinct part or portion of your trademark, you will have the right to oppose the application based on confusing similarity.</p>

<p>Opposition actions may be filed by interested third parties against a trademark application within a period of three (3) months following its publication in the official gazette. The probabilities of success for an opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.</p>

The amount of use needed to prevent this vulnerability is minimal.</p>

<p>The term of validity of a registered trademark in Brunei is of ten (10) years from the application date. It can then be renewed indefinitely for successive periods of ten years. The renewal may be requested as early as six (6) months before the expiration date and as late as six months after it; if the renewal is requested after the expiration date, late renewal fees will apply.</p>

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in Canada</h2>

<p>Trademark rights in Canada are established through use. This means that the person or company that first and continuously uses a trademark inside Canada is the one who has preferential rights over it.

<p>Nevertheless, if a third party eventually intends to register or use a trademark for similar goods or services that includes a primary or distinct part or portion of your trademark, you will have the right to oppose the application based on confusing similarity. Probabilities of success for an opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>Opposition actions against a trademark application must be presented within two (2) months from the date on which it is published in the Canadian trademark journal. The period to oppose a trademark may be increased to three (3) months upon payment of an extension fee.</p>

<p>Once the trademark has registered, the Canadian trademarks office will issue a digital certificate of registration. No hard copy of this certificate is issued.</p>

<p>The registered trademark in Canada will remain so for 10 years. Trademarks may be renewed every 10 years. If a trademark expires it may still be renewed during the grace period of 6 months after the expiration date.</p>

<p>If a registered trademark is not used for period of more than three (3) years, third parties may present cancellation actions on the ground of non-use. In certain circumstances non-use may be justified.</p>

<p>Visit our section for <a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademark-registration-united-kingdom" title="United Kingdom trademark registration information">trademark services in the United Kingdom</a> for further information regarding UK trademarks.</p>

<p>If the trademark is registered as an extension for protection of a trademark previously registered in the UK o through the EUIPO, the extension does not have to be made for all the classes included in the original registration. However, original registration must include the class or classes that one wishes to extend protection for in the Cayman Islands.</p>

<p>If the trademark that the extension is based upon is not renewed in its territory of origin, protection in the Cayman Islands will also lapse. Once the trademark is renewed in the territory of origin, then it can be renewed in the Cayman Islands. Although a trademark’s validity period in the Cayman Islands follows that of the registration in the country of origin, please be aware that annual maintenance fees are required in order to maintain the validity of a trademark in the Cayman Islands. Those fees must be paid before March 31st each year. It is possible to pay in advance all the annual fees due up to the next renewal date of the trademark.</p>

<p>Any changes or modifications to the registration of the trademark on which the extension is based, such as transfers of ownership or change of owner names, should also be recorded with the registration authority of the Cayman Islands within two (2) months of the change being recorded in the UK. If the changes to the trademark of origin are not recorded, enforcement actions will not be possible in cases of infringement to the trademark in the Cayman Islands.</p>

<p>Once accepted by the trademark office of the Cayman Islands, trademarks will be published for 60 days. During this period third parties may present opposition actions against the registration of the trademark in the Cayman Islands. The opposition stage of the trademark process was introduced in August of 2017.</p>

<p>If you register a combined trademark (which includes both word elements and figurative elements) in the Cayman Islands, the exclusive right to use the trademark is limited to a use of the trademark in the exact configuration or way in which it was filed and registered. If you wish to use the word element of your trademark separately from the logo (or vice versa), it is recommended you register for another trademark including only the word or figurative elements you wish to use and protect separately.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if a third party eventually intends to register or use a trademark for similar goods or services that includes a primary or distinct part or portion of your trademark, you will have the right to oppose the application based on confusing similarity. Probabilities of success for an opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>All our trademarks fees for Chile are all inclusive. Although national government fees have to be paid in Chilean pesos, payments to iGERENT are available in USD, EUR and GDP.</p>

<p>Regardless of the specific services you require for your trademark in Chile, we will always quote an exact amount. Our prices are flat and include government fees and professional fees.</p>

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in Chile</h2>

<p>In order to protect trademarks in Chile, they must necessarily be registered locally. Chile, as in most countries in Latin America, are the first to file jurisdiction when it comes to trademarks.</p>

<p>If you are doing business in Chile or are planning to do so you need to register your trademark. Owners of products or commercial establishments are in real danger of having their trademarks registered in Chile by third parties. Currently use of a trademark is not a requirement. Therefore, cases of trademarks being registered in bad faith are not uncommon.</p>

<p>No trademark rights are given to users of unregistered trademarks in Chile. There is no way to legally stop the use of an unregistered trademark. Trademark infringement in Chile can only be persecuted by the holder of a registered trademark.</p>

<p>The Chilean trademark system does allow for owners of unregistered trademarks to oppose the registration of their trademarks by third parties in some cases. The general rule however is that once the <a href="https://www.diariooficial.interior.gob.cl/tramites/marcas-y-patentes/conocer/" target="_blank" title="Trademark Gazette of Chile">trademark is published in the official gazette of Chile</a> only holders of registered trademarks in Chile can oppose the trademark within 30 days.</p>

<p>The registration of trademarks in Chile must be done through the <a href="https://www.inapi.cl/en/home" target="_blank" title="Trademark Office of Chile">National Institute of Intellectual Property (INAPI)</a>.</p>

<p>Foreign entities and foreign nationals can register trademarks in Chile. However, they will need to be represented by a local trademark agent. Original power of attorney documents will need to be sent to Chile. If a trademark is filed without the required power of attorney being presented the trademark application will face office actions.</p>

<h2>Carry out a trademark search in Chile before filing</h2>

<p>In Chile trademark searches can be carried out through the Chile trademark office database search tool. Only word elements in a trademark are publicly available when using the free Chile trademark search tool.</p>

<p>Although an initial trademark search in Chile may allow you to see if identical trademarks exist, it may not be enough to determine the real probabilities for a successful registration process.</p>

<p>At iGERENT we offer full trademark searches that are carried out by local Chilean trademark attorneys. This is important as not only identical trademarks will be considered. Similar trademarks as well as other considerations for refusal of a trademark in Chile are considered. Our full search also includes search of logos and trademark designs that may conflict with yours.</p>

<p>The trademark registration process in Chile takes around 9 months if not office action or third party oppositions are received. A full trademark search done by our experts can go a long way in order to identify possible problems and determine if it is worth the time and money it will take to initiate a trademark process.</p>

<h2>Trademark registration in Chile - process overview</h2>

<p>Actual use of a trademark is not necessary in order to file or register a trademark in Chile.</p>

<p>Once a trademark is filed the Chilean trademark office will first proceed with a formalities check. After the formalities check there will be a 20 day period for the owner or representative of the trademark to pay the publication fees. If the publication fees for the trademark are not paid, the trademark application will automatically lapse.</p>

<p>After the trademark is published there will be a 30 day period for other holder’s of Chilean trademarks to oppose the application. At the end of this period the Chilean trademark office will carry out a substantive trademark examination. This examination will include a formal search. The Chile trademark office search considers prior trademarks that may be considered similar.</p>

<p>If no office action is received and no third party oppositions are received the trademark will be accepted. After the trademark is accepted there are 60 days for the final fees to be paid. Only after the final fee is paid will the trademark be registered in Chile.</p>

<p>The days considered to determine a deadline are working days and include only Monday through Friday. Public holidays are not considered. For this reason the registration process in Chile may be longer in practice than when just considering the terms stated by the trademark office.</p>

<p>Once you have a Chile trademark registration the trademarks office will issue a digital certificate of registration. No hard copy of this certificate is issued.</p>

<h2>What to do after trademark registration in Chile</h2>

<p>It is highly recommended you use the “registration symbol” together with your trademark once it is registered in Chile. If a registered trademark is not marked with the ® (registration symbol) or with M.R. (abbreviation of Marca Registrada - registered mark in Spanish) when used, the owner of the trademark will not be able to prosecute criminal actions against infringers. However, civil actions will still be available for owners of registered trademarks, regardless of whether the mark was marked as registered when used.</p>

<p>Use of a trademark is not presently required to keep a registration live in Chile.</p>

<p>A registered trademark in Chile may be subject to a cancellation action if it has been registered in bad faith.</p>

<p>A registered trademark in Chile will be valid for 10 years. The registration period begins from the date of actual registration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trademarks may be renewed up to 12 months before the expiry date and may be renewed every 10 years. The trademark can also be renewed during the grace period of 30 days after the expiry date. Late renewals are subject to additional fees depending on how many months have passed from the trademark’s expiration once the trademark renewal in Chile is requested.</p>

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in China</h2>

<p>China is a “first-to-file” jurisdiction, meaning that it is necessary to register a trademark in order to obtain proprietary rights over it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Trademarks must be registered via the <a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="http://samr.saic.gov.cn/" target="_blank" title="China trademarks office">Trademark Office</a> of the State Administration for Industry &amp; Commerce of the People’s Republic of China.</p>

<p>China is also a&nbsp;<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/treaties/en/documents/pdf/madrid_marks.pdf" target="_blank" title="Madrid Member States">member state</a>&nbsp;to the Madrid Protocol. Thus, the extension of an international registration of a trademark via the Madrid System is possible for this country. For further information regarding our services for trademark filing through the Madrid System&nbsp;<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/madrid-system-trademark-registration" title="Madrid trademark services">click here</a>.</p>

<p>A registered trademark in China does not grant protection in Hong Kong or Macau. Visit our sections on these special administrative regions if you are interested in <a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademark-registration-hong-kong" title="Hong Kong trademark registration information">trademark registration in Hong Kong</a> or <a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademark-registration-macau" title="Macau trademark registration information">trademark registration in Macau</a>.</p>

<p>Taiwan, as an independent country, does not recognize chinese trademarks. Visit our section on Taiwan for further information regarding <a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademark-registration-taiwan" title="Taiwan trademark registration information">trademark registration in Taiwan</a>.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for a trademark to be in use for it to register. Prior use of the trademark can nevertheless be helpful in order to overcome an objection on the grounds of lack of distinctiveness. Additionally, registered trademarks must be used within a period of three years after registration, otherwise they become vulnerable to cancellation on the basis of non-use.</p>

<p>After the trademark office’s examination has been completed, trademark applications are published for a period of three months during which interested third parties may file an opposition against it.</p>

<p>In China registered trademarks are valid for a period of ten (10) years from the registration date. They can then be renewed for subsequent ten-year periods indefinitely. The renewal of the trademark can be requested as early as six (6) months before the expiration date and as late as six (6) months after pending the payment of a late renewal fee.</p>

<p>Please note that in order to confer a trademark owner the right to use the trademark in any color combination the filed logo (device) for the application should be in black and white. If the logo (device) is presented in color, the owner will only be conferred the right to use the trademark in the colors of the filed logo (device).&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you register a combined trademark (which includes both word elements and figurative elements) in China, the exclusive right to use the trademark is limited to a use of the trademark in the exact configuration or way in which it was filed and registered. If you wish to use the word element of your trademark separately from the logo (or vice versa), it is recommended you register for another trademark including only the word or figurative elements you wish to use and protect separately.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if a third party eventually intends to register or use a trademark for similar goods or services that includes a primary or distinct part or portion of your trademark, you will have the right to oppose the application based on confusing similarity. Probabilities of success for an opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please bear in mind that a significant number of people in China make their living by usurping foreign trademarks (AKA trademark squatters). Therefore, if China is a market that you are interested in entering in the future, either as a place to offer your goods and services, or manufacture the goods you wish to export, we HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you register your trademark.</p>

<p>If in the future you plan on selling your goods or offering your services inside the Chinese market, you should also register your trademark in Chinese characters.</p>

<p>For more information about trademark registration in China, including trademark squatters and the sub-class system, please read our article <a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademarks-and-china-preventing-great-wall-laments" title="Trademarks and China - Preventing a Great Wall of Laments">Trademarks and China – Preventing a Great Wall of Laments</a>.</p>

<p>For trademark search reports the trademark must be composed of the Latin alphabet and will only consider other trademarks in the Latin alphabet. If you wish to register a trademark that is composed of Pinyin or Hanzi characters (Chinese writing) the trademark search must consider trademarks written in Pinyin or Hanzi characters (Chinese writing). Please contact us if this is the case, additional fees will apply.</p>

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in Colombia</h2>

<p>In order to protect and have rights over a trademark in Colombia, it has to be registered locally through the Superintendence of Commerce and Industry (<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="http://www.sic.gov.co/marcas" target="_blank" title="Colombia trademarks office">SIC</a>).</p>

<p>Colombia is a also&nbsp;<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/treaties/en/documents/pdf/madrid_marks.pdf" target="_blank" title="Madrid Member States">member state</a>&nbsp;to the Madrid Protocol. Thus, the extension of an international registration of a trademark via the Madrid System is possible for this country. For further information regarding our services for trademark filing through the Madrid System&nbsp;<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/madrid-system-trademark-registration" title="Madrid trademark services">click here</a>.</p>

<p>If you register a combined trademark (which includes both word elements and figurative elements) in Colombia, the exclusive right to use the trademark is limited to a use of the trademark in the exact configuration or way in which it was filed and registered. If you wish to use the word element of your trademark separately from the logo (or vice versa), it is recommended you register for another trademark including only the word or figurative elements you wish to use and protect separately.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if a third party eventually intends to register or use a trademark for similar goods or services that includes a primary or distinct part or portion of your trademark, you will have the right to oppose the application based on confusing similarity. Probabilities of success for an opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>Opposition actions against trademarks in Colombia may be presented within thirty (30) business days from the date the application is published in the local trademark gazette.</p>

<p>Although it is not required to present proof or statements that a trademark is being used for it to be filed or granted registration, lack of actual use once a trademark has been registered may give way for third parties to present cancellation actions against a registered trademark. In order to avoid any possibility of this happening, a trademark should not go unused for more than three (3) years after the date it is successfully registered. Colombia is a member state of the Andean Pact (<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="http://www.comunidadandina.org/Seccion.aspx?id=83&amp;tipo=TE&amp;title=propiedad-intelectual" target="_blank" title="Andean Pact">CAN</a>), therefore, use of a trademark in order to prevent such actions may be done in any of the other member countries (<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademark-registration-bolivia" title="Bolivia trademark registration information">Bolivia</a>, <a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademark-registration-ecuador" title="Ecuador trademark registration information">Ecuador</a> or <a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademark-registration-peru" title="Peru trademark registration information">Peru</a>). Lack of use may be justified in certain circumstances.</p>

<p>A registered trademark in Colombia will be valid for ten (10) years. When the ten (year) period will be counted from will depend on whether the trademark was registered directly through the local trademark office or via the Madrid system. If the trademark is registered locally, the term will begin from the registration date. If the trademark was registered via the international trademark system, the ten (10) years will be from the international registration date. Trademarks may be renewed indefinitely every ten (10) years.</p>

<p>The trademark renewal can be requested as early as six (6) months before the expiration date. It can also be requested during the grace period of six (6) months after expiration, upon payment of a late renewal fee.</p>

<p>If you would like for the figurative or design elements of your trademark to be considered when assessing your trademark for registration in Colombia (Trademark Search Report), contact us directly in order to determine if we may be able to offer this in this jurisdiction. In such cases, prices for service and estimated delivery times may vary.</p>

<p>Once the trademark has registered, the trademarks office will issue a digital certificate of registration. No hard copy of this certificate is issued.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in Costa Rica</h2>

<p>Trademark rights in Costa Rica are established through use. Thus the person or company that first and continuously uses a trademark inside Costa Rica is the one who will have preferential rights over it. However, in practice, it is highly recommended trademark owners register their trademarks. The main benefit of registering a trademark is to have presumption of ownership of the mark. Having the trademark registered will prove useful in cases of infringement.</p>

<p>If one does not have their trademark registered in Costa Rica, one may still oppose the application of the trademark presented by another; in this case, prior use will have to be proven.</p>

<p>Trademarks in Costa Rica are registered through the National Register of the Republic of Costa Rica (<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://www.rnpdigital.com/propiedad_industrial/index.htm" target="_blank" title="Costa Rica trademarks office">RNP</a>).</p>

<p>If you register a combined trademark (which includes both word elements and figurative elements) in Costa Rica, the exclusive right to use the trademark is limited to a use of the trademark is limited to a use of the trademark in the exact configuration or way in which it was filed and registered. If you wish to use the word element of your trademark separately from the logo (or vice versa), it is recommended you register for another trademark including only the word or figurative elements you wish to use and protect separately.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if a third party eventually intends to register or use a trademark for similar goods or services that includes a primary or distinct part or portion of your trademark, you will have the right to oppose the application based on confusing similarity. Probabilities of success for an opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>Opposition actions against the registration of a trademark in Costa Rica can be presented within two (2) months from the date of first publication of the trademark in the Intellectual Property Gazette of Costa Rica. If one wishes to oppose a trademark application without having previously filed or registered one’s trademarks, filing of the trademark is compulsory and will have to be done within 15 days of having presented the opposition action.</p>

<p>A registered trademark in Costa Rica will last for ten (10) years from the date of registration. Trademarks may be renewed indefinitely for periods of ten (10) years. Trademarks may be renewed up to 12 months before their date of expiration. Once a trademark has lapsed there is a six-month grace period for late renewals upon payment of late fees.</p>

<p>Once a trademark is registered, if it is not used in Costa Rica within five (5) years, third parties may present cancellation actions against the registration on basis of non-use. In order to overcome cancellation actions based on non-use, it is enough to demonstrate minimal use of the trademark.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Emirate of Dubai is one of the United Arab Emirates. It has no local trademarks office; trademark protection is obtained by registering a trademark that is valid for the whole United Arab Emirates. Trademark applications are filed with the trademark department of the Ministry of Economy of the United Arab Emirates (<a href="http://www.economy.gov.ae/english/Ministry/MinistrySectors/Pages/CopyRightSector.aspx" target="_blank" title="United Arab Emirates trademarks office">IPOUAE</a>).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The rights to a trademark in Dubai (UAE) are granted to the person or company that first uses it in this territory. Although registration is not mandatory, in practice it is highly recommended in order to demonstrate clear ownership, prevent future conflicts regarding ownership of the trademark and in order to defend against cases of trademark infringement. It is difficult and expensive to enforce an unregistered mark.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is not necessary for a trademark to be in use in Dubai or the United Arab Emirates in order for it to register.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you register a combined trademark (which includes both word elements and figurative elements) in Dubai (UAE), the exclusive right to use the trademark is limited to a use of the trademark in the exact configuration or way in which it was filed and registered. If you wish to use the word element of your trademark separately from the logo (or vice versa), it is recommended you register for another trademark including only the word or figurative elements you wish to use and protect separately.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, if a third party eventually intends to register or use a trademark for similar goods or services that includes a primary or distinct part or portion of your trademark, you will have the right to oppose the application based on confusing similarity.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Opposition actions may be filed by third parties against a trademark application within thirty (30) days after the date of its publication in the official gazette. The probabilities of success for an opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Although a trademark does not have to be in use in order for it to register, it must not go unused for periods of five years or it will become vulnerable to cancellation actions based on lack of use of the trademark. The granting of a license of use to another party may be considered as use of the trademark.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Registered trademarks in Dubai (UAE) have a validity of ten (10) years from the application date and can be renewed indefinitely for further periods of ten (10) years. The trademark renewal can be requested as early as twelve (12) months before the expiration date. It can also be requested during the grace period of three (3) months after expiration, upon payment of a late renewal fee.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">For trademark search reports the trademark must be in Latin alphabet and will only consider other trademarks in Latin alphabet. If you wish for a search for a trademark written in the local writing system (Arabic) and that includes results of trademarks in the local alphabet (Arabic), please contact us. Additional fees will apply.</p>

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in Ecuador</h2>

<p>As a first-to-file jurisdiction, in order to protect trademarks in Ecuador they must necessarily be registered locally. Exceptionally in the case of famous and well-known trademarks, actions may be presented in certain circumstances of infringement even if these have not been registered in Ecuador.</p>

<p>Although use of a trademark does not grant rights, prior use to filing may prove useful in order to overcome initial refusals from the trademark office to register the trademark based on the lack of distinctiveness.</p>

<p>In order to register a trademark in Ecuador, an application will have to be filed through the Ecuadorian Institute of Intellectual Property (<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="http://www.propiedadintelectual.gob.ec/" target="_blank" title="Ecuador trademarks office">IEPI</a>).</p>

<p>Please note that by default the application of trademarks that include figurative or design elements in Ecuador will be filed without color claim. If you wish to claim colors please instruct us to do so. If color is claimed, use of the registered trademark will be restricted to those for which color is claimed. Additional charges may apply for claiming color.</p>

<p>If you register a combined trademark (which includes both word elements and figurative elements)&nbsp;in Ecuador, the exclusive right to use the trademark is limited to a use of the trademark in the exact configuration or way in which it was filed and registered. If you wish to use the word element of your trademark separately from the logo (or vice versa), it is recommended you register for another trademark including only the word or figurative elements you wish to use and protect separately.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if a third party eventually intends to register or use a trademark for similar goods or services that includes a primary or distinct part or portion of your trademark, you will have the right to oppose the application based on confusing similarity. Probabilities of success for an opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>Opposition actions against the registration of a trademark in Ecuador may be presented within thirty (30) business days after the date the mark is published in the monthly gazette. Publication of the trademark is prior to the formal examination by the registration office.</p>

<p>Although it is not required to present proof or statements that a trademark is being used for it to be filed or granted registration in Ecuador, lack of actual use once a trademark has been registered may give way for third parties to present cancellation actions against the trademark in Ecuador. In order to prevent this from happening, a trademark should not go unused for more than three (3) years after the date it is successfully registered. Use of the mark must be on a commercial scale. Lack of use may be justified in certain circumstances.</p>

<p>Ecuador is a member state of the Andean Pact (<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="http://www.comunidadandina.org/Seccion.aspx?id=83&amp;tipo=TE&amp;title=propiedad-intelectual" target="_blank" title="Andean Pact">CAN</a>), therefore, use of a trademark in order to prevent such actions may take place in any of the other member countries (<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademark-registration-bolivia" title="Bolivia trademark registration information">Bolivia</a>, <a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademark-registration-colombia" title="Colombia trademark registration information">Colombia</a> or <a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademark-registration-peru" title="Peru trademark registration information">Peru</a>).</p>

<p>A registered trademark in Ecuador will be valid for ten (10) years, term that begins from the date of actual registration. Trademarks may be renewed up to six (6) months before the expiry date and may be renewed every ten (10) years. There is a grace period of six (6) months for trademarks that are not renewed before their expiry date. Extra charges for late renewal apply.</p>

<p>A trademark registered in Finland, whether locally or via the European Union trademark, also grants protection in the Åland Islands.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for a trademark to be in use in Finland in order for it to register. However, prior use may be useful as it can help overcome an objection raised on the grounds of lack of distinctiveness, by proving that the trademark has acquired distinctiveness.</p>

<p>If you register a combined trademark (which includes both word elements and figurative elements) in Finland, the exclusive right to use the trademark is limited to a use of the trademark in the exact configuration or way in which it was filed and registered. If you wish to use the word element of your trademark separately from the logo (or vice versa), it is recommended you register for another trademark including only the word or figurative elements you wish to use and protect separately.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if a third party eventually intends to register or use a trademark for similar goods or services that includes a primary or distinct part or portion of your trademark, you will have the right to oppose the application based on confusing similarity.</p>

<p>Trademark oppositions in Finland can be filed during the period of two months that follows the date of publication of the trademark application in the official bulletin. The probabilities of success for an opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>Although a trademark does not have to be in use in order for it to register, it must not go unused for periods of five years or it will become vulnerable to cancellation actions based on lack of use of the trademark. The amount of use must be on a commercial scale.</p>

<p>Registered trademarks in Finland have a validity of ten (10) years from the registration date and can be renewed indefinitely for further periods of ten (10) years. The trademark renewal can be requested as early as twelve (12) months before the expiration date. It can also be requested during the grace period of six (6) months after expiration, upon payment of a late renewal fee.</p>

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in France</h2>

<p>To obtain trademark protection in France, one can either file a local application or a European Union trademark.</p>

<p>Local applications are filed through the Institut National de la Propriété Industrielle (<a href="http://www.inpi.fr" target="_blank" title="France trademarks office">INPI</a>),&nbsp;and automatically grant protection in Martinique, Guadeloupe, St. Barthélemy, French Saint-Martin, French Guiana, Reunion Island, New Caledonia, Wallis and Futuna Islands, Mayotte, Saint-Pierre and Miquelon and the French Southern and Antarctic Lands. The trademarks may be extended to the French Polynesia.</p>

<p><a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademark-registration-european-union" title="EU trademark services">European Union Trademarks (EUTM)</a>&nbsp;offer protection in France as well as all the other member countries of the European Union.</p>

<p>If you register a combined trademark (which includes both word elements and figurative elements) in France, the exclusive right to use the trademark is limited to a use of the trademark is limited to a use of the trademark in the exact configuration or way in which it was filed and registered. If you wish to use the word element of your trademark separately from the logo (or vice versa), it is recommended you register for another trademark including only the word or figurative elements you wish to use and protect separately.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if a third party eventually intends to register or use a trademark for similar goods or services that includes a primary or distinct part or portion of your trademark, you will have the right to oppose the application based on confusing similarity. Probabilities of success for an opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the application has been filed, the INPI will simultaneously publish it and begin the examination to check whether the trademark is acceptable for registration. The INPI does not check the existence of identical or confusingly similar filed or registered trademarks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In order to check before filing whether a trademark have high chances of being considered as suitable for registration, you can order a trademark search. This can be done locally for trademarks filed only in France, or you can widen the scope and order a <a href="https://igerent.com/trademark-registration-european-union" title="European Union Trademark Search">European Union trademark search</a>, which will also reveal similar trademarks filed or registered in any other EU country.</p>

<p>During the publication period of two months from the publication date, third parties can file both oppositions based on a prior right (for instance, a previously registered trademark) or observations based on absolute grounds (for example, that the proposed mark is merely descriptive).&nbsp;</p>

<p>France is a “first-to-file” jurisdiction, which means that except in some specific cases, the rights to a trademark are granted to the first person to file it, not the first person to use it. Use of the trademark before registration is not necessary and will not help overcome objections raised on grounds of lack of distinctiveness.</p>

<p>Although it is not necessary to use the trademark for it to register, it must be used within a period of 5 years since the last use, otherwise it will become vulnerable to cancellation for non-use. The amount of use in France must be on a commercial scale.</p>

<p>A trademark is registered for an initial period of 10 years starting from the date of filing of the application, after which it can be renewed for periods of 10 years. The renewal request can be filed starting 6 months before the expiration date, and until 6 months after the expiration date. In case the renewal is filed after the expiration date, extra costs will apply.</p>

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in Georgia</h2>

<p>In Georgia, trademark registration is mandatory to be granted rights over a trademark, as it is a "first to file" jurisdiction.

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in Guernsey</h2>

<p>The rights to a trademark in Guernsey are granted to the person or company that first uses it in this territory. Although registration is not mandatory, in practice it is highly recommended in order to demonstrate clear ownership, prevent future conflicts regarding ownership of the trademark and in order to defend against cases of trademark infringement.</p>

<p>Although in the past it was necessary to have a trademark registered in another jurisdiction in order to obtain a registration in Guernsey, this is no longer the case.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Gulf Cooperation Council, commonly referred to as the GCC, is an organization formed by the countries of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.</p>

<p>The GCC is taking important steps in improving provisions in the trademark laws of each of its member countries to allow trademarks matters to be handled more efficiently and uniformly in all countries that compose the GCC.</p>

<p>For information regarding trademarks and services for any of the individual member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council, please visit our individual country pages:</p>

<p><a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademark/middle-east/trademark-registration-bahrain" title="Bahrain Trademark Registration">Bahrain</a>,&nbsp;<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademark/middle-east/trademark-registration-kuwait" title="Trademark Registration in Kuwait">Kuwait</a>,&nbsp;<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademark/middle-east/trademark-registration-oman" title="Trademark Registration in Oman">Oman</a>,&nbsp;<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademark/middle-east/trademark-registration-qatar" title="Qatar Trademark Registration">Qatar</a>,&nbsp;<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademark/middle-east/trademark-registration-saudi-arabia" title="Saudi Arabia Trademark Registration">Saudi Arabia</a>,&nbsp;<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademark/middle-east/trademark-registration-united-arab-emirates" title="United Arab Emirates trademark registration">United Arab Emirates</a></p>

<p>Unlike other regional agreements that allow for a single trademark application and subsequent registration to grant protection in all member states, in the case of the GCC, in order for a trademark to be protected in all member states, it will have to be filed and registered in all six member countries directly. The GCC currently does not contemplate an individual trademark for all member countries, nor are there any plans to do so in the future. What the GCC is currently setting out to achieve is for the trademark laws and processes of all countries that belong to the organization be similar.</p>

<p>Therefore, although great steps have been taken to harmonize trademark matters in these countries, currently and in the future, trademark holders will have to apply for their trademarks directly in each member country&nbsp;of the GCC in which they want their trademarks protected. As a trademark owner, you may choose to register your trademark in one or more countries of the GCC. When filing a trademark in any of the GCC member states, you are not obligated to register your trademark in the other GCC member countries.</p>

<h3>The key factors that GCC countries are setting out to establish may be subdivided in three main categories:</h3>

<p><strong>What can be registered as a trademark in GCC member countries</strong></p>

<p>The definition of what constitutes a trademark will include sound marks, smell marks and single colors.</p>

<p><strong>How a trademark can be registered in GCC member countries</strong></p>

<p>Certified translations and transliterations of trademarks that are not in Arabic will have to be presented at the moment of filing.</p>

<p>Multiclass applications will be allowed. Currently, in some member countries, if a trademark is to be registered in more than one class, independent applications for each class have to be filed. With multiclass applications on the way, the costs of registration should decrease for trademarks that will be registered in more than one class.</p>

<p>Priority may be claimed when filing a trademark based on a previous foreign application.</p>

<p>Considerations as to whether identical or similar trademarks exist will not be limited to the class under which a trademark is filed. Confusing similarity also take into account trademarks filed or registered for similar goods or services even if they fall in different classes.</p>

<p><strong>How a trademark&nbsp;</strong><strong>can&nbsp;</strong><strong>be enforced in GCC member countries</strong></p>

<p>Protection of well-known trademarks is to improve in regards to what constitutes a well-known trademark. Well-known trademarks in GCC countries will not have to be registered in order to be granted protection. The translation of a well-known trademark will now also have protection.</p>

<p>Finally, once registered, if a trademark is not used for a period of 5 years in the member country&nbsp;of the GCC in which it is registered, third parties will be able to present cancellations actions against the registered trademark.</p>

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in Guyana</h2>

<p>In order to protect a trademark in Guyana, it will have to be registered locally through the trademark office, dependent of the <a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="http://legalaffairs.gov.gy/contact-us" target="_blank" title="Guyana trademarks office">Ministry of Legal Affairs</a> of Guyana.</p>

<p>Registration of a trademark for products this may be done directly through the trademark office as an independent registration or by extending the registration of an already registered trademark in the United Kingdom. Trademarks for products are those that correspond to classes 01 to 34 of the Nice Classification System.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If one wishes to register a mark that is to be used in connection to services (service mark), direct local registration in Guyana is not possible. In this case it would be necessary to have previously registered the service mark in the United Kingdom, and then to extend such trademark to Guyana. Service marks are those that correspond to classes 35 to 45 of the Nice Classification System.</p>

<p>The process to register based on a UK trademark takes approximately six (6) months. Trademark registered independently will take considerably longer to be registered.</p>

<p>For information regarding UK trademark for Guyana, visit our section on <a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademark-registration-united-kingdom" title="United Kingdom trademark registration information">trademark services in the United Kingdom</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you register a combined trademark (which includes both word elements and figurative elements)&nbsp;in Guyana, the exclusive right to use the trademark is limited to a use of the trademark in the exact configuration or way in which it was filed and registered. If you wish to use the word element of your trademark separately from the logo (or vice versa), it is recommended you register for another trademark including only the word or figurative elements you wish to use and protect separately. For information regarding our services for trademark in the United Kingdom, please click here.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if a third party eventually intends to register or use a trademark for similar goods or services that includes a primary or distinct part or portion of your trademark, you will have the right to oppose the application based on confusing similarity. Probabilities of success for an opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>Opposition actions against a trademark in Guyana may be presented within one (1) month after trademark is published in the Official Gazette of Guyana.</p>

<p>Although it is not required than one prove or declare that a trademark is in use in Guyana before filing it or before it may be accepted for registration, if one does not use a trademark within three (3) years from the date it is registered, third parties may present cancellation actions against the trademark based on lack of use.</p>

<p>A trademark that is directly and independently registered in Guyana will be initially valid for seven (7) years and may be renewed for periods of 14 years. Trademarks that are extended and based on UK trademarks will follow the validity periods established for UK trademarks.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Why and How to Register a Trademark in Haiti</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Haiti, the exclusive rights to a trademark are granted only by registration, as it is a “first-to-file” jurisdiction. However, in exceptional cases, well-known trademark can be protected even if they have not been filed yet.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Trademark applications must be filed with the <a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="http://registre.mci.gouv.ht/" target="_blank" title="Haiti trademarks office">Intellectual Property Service</a> in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you register a combined trademark (which includes both word elements and figurative elements) in Haiti, the exclusive right to use the trademark is limited to a use of the trademark in the exact configuration or way in which it was filed and registered. If you wish to use the word element of your trademark separately from the logo (or vice versa), it is recommended you register for another trademark including only the word or figurative elements you wish to use and protect separately.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, if a third party eventually intends to register or use a trademark for similar goods or services that includes a primary or distinct part or portion of your trademark, you will have the right to oppose the application based on confusing similarity.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In Haiti, the opposition period is open for a period of two months starting on the publication date, during which interested third parties may file opposition actions. The probabilities of success for an opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you would like for the figurative or design elements of your trademark to be considered when assessing your trademark for registration in Haiti (Trademark Search Report), contact us directly in order to determine if we may be able to offer this in this jurisdiction. In such cases, prices for service and estimated delivery times may vary.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While a trademark does not need to be in use to register in Haiti, it must then be used continuously and in good faith in order to maintain its validity. Lack of use during the first five years of registration makes it vulnerable to cancellation actions for lack of use.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, during the lifespan of the trademark, declarations of use must be submitted to establish that the trademark is still in use. If those declarations are not submitted in a timely manner, then the registration will lapse. For more information, please refer to our FAQ section below.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Provided that declarations of use have been filed when necessary, registered trademarks in Haiti have a validity of ten years from the registration date and can then be renewed for successive periods of ten years indefinitely, as long as the trademark is still being used. There is a grace period of six (6) months after the expiration of the trademark during which it may still be renewed upon payment of additional fees.</p>

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in Hong Kong</h2>

<p>In Hong Kong registration is not mandatory to obtain trademark rights, as prior use of a trademark can be recognized. However, registration is always recommended as it grants presumption of ownership and helps enforce the trademark.</p>

<p>Trademarks are registered via the Hong Kong Intellectual Property Department (<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="http://www.ipd.gov.hk/eng/home.htm" target="_blank" title="Hong Kong trademarks office">IPD</a>). Note that although the People’s Republic of China has sovereignty over Hong Kong, both territories still maintain separate registration systems and therefore a <a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademark-registration-china" title="China trademark registration information">trademark registered in China</a> does NOT have validity in Hong Kong, nor will it grant <a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademark-registration-macau" title="Macau trademark registration information">trademark protection in Macau</a>.</p>

<p>Use prior to filing or registering is not compulsory; however, it may help demonstrate that the trademark has acquired distinctiveness in case an objection is received that the mark lacks distinctiveness.</p>

<p>If you register a combined trademark (which includes both word elements and figurative elements) in Hong Kong, the exclusive right to use the trademark is limited to a use of the trademark in the exact configuration or way in which it was filed and registered. If you wish to use the word element of your trademark separately from the logo (or vice versa), it is recommended you register for another trademark including only the word or figurative elements you wish to use and protect separately.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if a third party eventually intends to register or use a trademark for similar goods or services that includes a primary or distinct part or portion of your trademark, you will have the right to oppose the application based on confusing similarity. Probabilities of success for an opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Hong Kong it is possible to file an opposition against an application during a period of three months from the publication date. Within this period an extension for a further two-month period can be requested.</p>

<p>A trademark must be used within three years after the registration date otherwise it will become vulnerable to cancellation from non-use. The use can be minimal as long as it is genuine.</p>

<p>Trademarks have a validity of ten (10) years from the filing date. Renewal can be requested in the six (6) months preceding the expiry date. After the expiry date, the trademark can be renewed within six (6) months upon payment of late fees, and during a further six months after that provided valid reasons are given; the validity of such reasons is subject to the appreciation of the trademarks office.</p>

<p>For trademark assessment reports the trademark must be composed of the Latin alphabet and will only consider other trademarks in the Latin alphabet.

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in Hungary</h2>

<p>In Hungary, trademark registration is mandatory to be granted rights over a trademark, as it is a "first to file" jurisdiction. Only in some exceptional cases can an unregistered trademark be protected.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Trademark registration in India</h2>

<p>Filing a trademark for India does not necessarily have to be done directly before the Indian trademark office. India is a <a href="https://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/treaties/en/documents/pdf/madrid_marks.pdf" target="_blank" title="Member states to the Madrid system">member state to the Madrid protocol</a> for registration of international trademarks. Depending on the circumstances of the applicant, <a href="https://igerent.com/madrid-system-trademark-registration" title="International trademark registration via Madrid system">filing an international application through the Madrid system</a> may be an option with exploring.</p>

<p>Once a trademark is filed in India it will be examined by the trademark authority. The examination process includes search for prior trademarks that may be similar. Similar trademarks are not the only issue the Indian trademark office will consider. Trademark examination will also consider if the trademark is descriptive, generic or if other causes for refusal exist.</p>

<p>Once the examination process is overcome the trademark will be published through the <a href="https://ipindia.gov.in/journal-tm.htm" target="_blank" title="Indian trademark journal for the publication of trademarks">Indian trademark journal</a>. After this there will be a period of 120 days for third parties to present trademark opposition actions against your application.</p>

<p>A trademark certificate will be granted if all stages of the registration process are successfully passed. The trademark certificate serves as a title of ownership for the Indian trademark.</p>

<h2>After your trademark registration in India is complete</h2>

<p>It is important that registered trademarks are used in India. If you do not use a trademark for more than 5 years within the Indian market it may be cancelled.</p>

<p>Trademark cancellation will not be automatic. A third party would need to file a trademark cancellation action before the Indian intellectual property office. If your Indian trademark is cancelled you will lose all rights over the trademark.</p>

<p>If you effectively use your trademark, you will not have to worry about cancellation actions. Use of the trademark in India has to be exactly as it was registered. If you modify your trademark in any way you should consider applying for the new version of your trademark. Use your intellectual property to secure it.</p>

<p>If you have your trademark in India registered you have the exclusive right to use it. It is important you protect your trademark rights. You will be able to start legal proceedings if you are a victim of trademark infringement in India. &nbsp;Monitoring to see if third parties are using your trademark without the corresponding permission &nbsp;is highly recommended.</p>

<p>As the owner of a registered trademark you can prevent others from registering trademark that may be similar to yours. Preventing similar trademarks is important in order to allow your trademark to be clearly recognized in the Indian market.</p>

If a trademark lapses due to lack of renewal there is no way to revive the trademark.

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in Japan</h2>

<p>Japan is a “first-to-file” jurisdiction, meaning that it is necessary to register a trademark in order to obtain proprietary rights over it. However, in exceptional cases, well-known trademark can be protected even if they have not been filed yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trademark applications in Japan must be filed with the Japan Patent Office (<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="http://www.jpo.go.jp/index.htm" target="_blank" title="Japan trademarks office">JPO</a>).</p>

<p>Japan is also a&nbsp;<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/treaties/en/documents/pdf/madrid_marks.pdf" target="_blank" title="Madrid Member States">member state</a>&nbsp;to the Madrid Protocol. Thus, the extension of an international registration of a trademark via the Madrid System is possible for this country.

<p>It is not necessary for a trademark to be used in Japan for it to register. However, if it is not used during a term of five years after the registration, it will become vulnerable to cancellation actions based on lack of use.</p>

<p>If you register a combined trademark (which includes both word elements and figurative elements) in Japan, the exclusive right to use the trademark is limited to a use of the trademark in the exact configuration or way in which it was filed and registered. If you wish to use the word element of your trademark separately from the logo (or vice versa), it is recommended you register for another trademark including only the word or figurative elements you wish to use and protect separately.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if a third party eventually intends to register or use a trademark for similar goods or services that includes a primary or distinct part or portion of your trademark, you will have the right to oppose the application based on confusing similarity. Probabilities of success for an opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>During the examination process, any third party can provide useful information for examination to the Trademarks office, such as any grounds making the trademark unfit for registration. This third party does not have to have any prior right or interest in the trademark; in fact, they can remain anonymous if they so wish.</p>

<p>Once the trademarks office has completed the formal and substantive examinations and the trademark registration is granted, a certificate will be issued and the grant will be published. Third parties then have a period of two months to oppose the registration, based on prior rights to the trademark or absolute grounds of irregistrability.</p>

<p>Registered trademarks in Japan are valid for a renewable term of ten (10) years which starts on the registration date. Renewals can be requested as early as six (6) months before the expiration date, and as late as six (6) months afterwards upon payment of a late renewal fee.</p>

<p>For trademark search reports the trademark must be composed of the Latin alphabet and will only consider other trademarks in the Latin alphabet. If you wish to register a trademark that is composed of katakana characters (Japanese writing) the trademark search must consider trademarks written in katakana characters (Japanese writing). Please contact us if this is the case, additional fees will apply.</p>

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in Malawi</h2>

<p>In order for a trademark to be protected in Malawi, registration is not mandatory. In Malawi, the rights to a trademark are granted to the person or company that first uses the trademark. In order to claim rights to an unregistered trademark through use, such use should be substantial and longstanding.</p>

<p>However, in practice, it is highly advisable to register the trademark in order to prevent others from using it or claiming ownership of it. A registered trademark grants presumption of ownership, offering a large advantage to the holder in case future disputes should arise. In Malawi, local registration is done through the Department of the Registrar General Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for a trademark to be in use in Malawi in order for it to register. However, prior use may be useful as it can help overcome an objection raised on the grounds of lack of distinctiveness, by proving that the trademark has acquired distinctiveness. Furthermore, registered trademarks may be subject to cancellation actions presented by third parties if they are not used for a period of five (5) consecutive years.</p>

<p>If you register a combined trademark (which includes both word elements and figurative elements) in Malawi, the exclusive right to use the trademark is limited to a use of the trademark in the exact configuration or way in which it was filed and registered. If you wish to use the word element of your trademark separately from the logo (or vice versa), it is recommended you register for another trademark including only the word or figurative elements you wish to use and protect separately.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if a third party eventually intends to register or use a trademark for similar goods or services that includes a primary or distinct part or portion of your trademark, you will have the right to oppose the application based on confusing similarity. The probabilities of success for an opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances. The time frame to present opposition actions is two (2) months following the date on which the conflicting trademark is published in the local gazette.</p>

<p>A newly registered trademark in Malawi will be valid for seven (7) years, period that will start from the registration date. Trademarks may be subsequently renewed for periods of 14 years. There is no limit to how many times a trademark may be renewed. Trademarks must be renewed within six (6) months prior to the renewal date.</p>

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in Malta</h2>

<p>The rights to a trademark in Malta are granted to the person or company that first uses it in this territory.

<p>It is not necessary for a trademark to be in use in Malta in order for it to register. However, it must not go unused for periods of more than five (5) years or it will become vulnerable to cancelation actions for lack of use. In order to avoid this, the trademark must be used on a commercial scale.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All official trademark fees in Mexico are in Mexican pesos. However, when working through iGERENT our prices can be paid in USD, EUR or GDP. All our fees for trademark services include all government fees and professional fees.</p>

<p>We will always quote you on the exact amount our trademark services cost, whatever these might be.</p>

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in Mexico</h2>

<p>Owners of Mexican trademarks are granted exclusive rights to the trademark in Mexico. To register a trademark in Mexico the application will need to be filed through the <a href="https://www.gob.mx/impi" target="_blank" title="Mexican trademark office">Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (IMPI)</a>.</p>

<p>If you have not registered your trademark in Mexico but are already using it you are not granted any rights. Enforcement of trademark rights in Mexico is extremely difficult in the case of unregistered trademarks.</p>

<p>Cancellation actions against a registered trademark are available even if you do not have a trademark registered in Mexico. For this you will have to show that you effectively used the trademark before the filing date of the conflicting mark.</p>

<h2>Trademark search in Mexico</h2>

<p>Applying for a trademark in Mexico does not ensure that it will be registered. Before starting the process and paying the required filing fees we recommend you first start with a trademark search in Mexico.</p>

<p>A Mexico trademark office search is optional. We do recommend it as it will alert you of possible conflicting trademarks that may already exist in Mexico. Our trademark search report in Mexico also includes a detailed analysis of possible conflicts that may arise during the registration process. Our trademark agents will provide you with recommendations on the steps that should be taken before starting the registration process.</p>

<p>A full trademark search allows you to know if it is worth starting a trademark registration process in Mexico. This may save you a considerable amount of resources and time.</p>

<h2>The process to trademark registration in Mexico</h2>

<p>Foreign nationals can register a trademark in Mexico. However, under Mexican law they will need to be represented by a local intellectual property attorney. A power of attorney document enabling the trademark agent to represent the foreign national or company will need to be presented.</p>

<p>We have an international network of intellectual property attorneys that will be able to handle your trademark needs. Our Mexican trademark attorneys are standing by to help you with all your trademark needs.</p>

<p>The process to register a trademark in Mexico is very fast. The trademark registration process does not take more than 6 months unless opposition actions are received. This is significantly faster than <a href="https://igerent.com/trademark-registration-united-states" title="Trademark registration in USA">registering a trademark in the United States</a>.</p>

<p>The Mexico trademark office will carry out a search of prior trademarks filed or registered through the Mexican trademark office database. Only live trademarks will be considered by the Mexican trademark authority at this stage.</p>

<p>Once a trademark has been accepted it will be <a href="https://siga.impi.gob.mx/newSIGA/content/common/principal.jsf" target="_blank" title="Mexican trademark journal for the publication of trademarks">published in the Mexican trademark journal</a> for opposition purposes. After publication there is a one month period in which anybody can oppose your trademark´s registration. The grounds for opposition are set out in <a href="http://dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5523102&amp;fecha=18/05/2018" target="_blank" title="Industrial property law of Mexico">Article 90 of the Industrial Property Law of Mexico</a>.</p>

<p>If the trademark process is successful the Mexican trademark office will then grant a trademark certificate.</p>

<p>Mexico is a <a href="https://www.wipo.int/madrid/en/members/" target="_blank" title="Member states to the Madrid system">member state to the Madrid Protocol</a>. Apart from filing your trademark directly through the Mexican trademark office, extending an international trademark to Mexico is also possible. Mexico is part of the Madrid System. Contact us for further information regarding our services for <a href="https://igerent.com/madrid-system-trademark-registration" title="International trademark registration via Madrid system">international trademark registration for Mexico via the Madrid System</a>.</p>

<h2>Actions to take after trademark registration in Mexico</h2>

<p>Registration of a trademark is the first step to protecting your mark. Use of the trademark is required for the trademark to keep live. If you did not use the trademark the risk of receiving trademark cancellation actions against your registration was a possibility. Not using a trademark in Mexico does not only put your trademark at risk but will lead to its automatic cancellation.</p>

<p>The trademark owner will need to file a declaration of use every three years after a trademark is registered in Mexico. The declaration of use is done through the Mexican trademark office. Evidence of use of the trademark within the Mexican market may be required.</p>

<p>If a declaration of use of a Mexican trademark is not presented under Mexican trademark law the mark will automatically lapse. This will happen after three month from the date in which the declaration of use should have been presented.</p>

<h2>Trademark renewal in Mexico - Keep your Mexican trademark live</h2>

<p>Once you have registered a trademark in Mexico you will be granted a trademark certificate of registration. The certificate of registration in Mexico allows you to demonstrate you do in fact own the trademark. However, the property right in Mexico is not indefinite.</p>

<p>A Mexican trademark is only valid for a period of 10 years. The 10 year period of validity of the trademark is not from the date it was successfully registered. The 10 years for the date the trademark was filed through the trademark office.</p>

<p>The trademark owner will need to renew the trademark six months before the expiration date. A further six month window exists to renew the trademark after its ending date.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if a third party eventually intends to register or use a trademark for similar goods or services that includes a primary or distinct part or portion of your trademark, you will have the right to file post-registration actions against the trademark during a period of one (1) year after registration. The probabilities of success for a post-registration opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>Although a trademark does not have to be in use in order for it to register, it must not go unused for longer than five years after registration or it will become vulnerable to cancellation actions based on lack of use of the trademark.</p>

<p>The term of validity of a registered trademark in Mongolia is of ten (10) years from the application date. It can then be renewed indefinitely for successive periods of ten years.

<p>Once a trademark application is filed, it will be published in the Trademarks Register for a period of two months during which interested third parties may file oppositions against the trademark application based on their prior rights. At the same time, the BOIP will conduct a substantive examination to determine whether the application complies with the registration requirements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you register for a combined trademark in Benelux (includes both word elements + figurative elements) the exclusive right to use the TM is limited to a use of the trademark in the exact configuration or way in which it was filed and registered. If you wish to use the word element of your trademark separately from the logo (or vice versa), it is recommended you register for another trademark including only the word or figurative elements you wish to use and protect separately.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if a third party eventually intends to register or use a trademark for similar goods or services that includes a primary or distinct part or portion of your trademark, you will have the right to oppose the application based on confusing similarity. Probabilities of success for an opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>Registered trademarks in Benelux have a validity of ten (10) years from the date of application. It can then be renewed for successive periods of ten years indefinitely. The trademark renewal can be requested as early as six (6) months before the expiration date and as late as six months after it, upon payment of late renewal fees.</p>

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in New Zealand</h2>

<p>In New Zealand registration is not mandatory to obtain trademark rights, as extensive prior use of a trademark can be recognized. However, registration is always highly recommended as it grants presumption of ownership and helps enforce the trademark. It is costlier and more difficult to enforce one’s rights over an unregistered trademark.</p>

<p>Trademark applications in New Zealand are filed with the Intellectual Property Office of New Zealand (<a href="http://www.iponz.govt.nz/cms" target="_blank" title="New Zealand trademarks office">IPONZ</a>).</p>

<p>New Zealand is a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/treaties/en/documents/pdf/madrid_marks.pdf" target="_blank" title="Madrid Member States">member state</a>&nbsp;to the Madrid Protocol. Thus, the extension of an international registration of a trademark via the Madrid System is possible for this country.

<p>If you register a combined trademark (which includes both word elements and figurative elements)&nbsp;in New Zealand, the exclusive right to use the trademark is limited to a use of the trademark in the exact configuration or way in which it was filed and registered. If you wish to use the word element of your trademark separately from the logo (or vice versa), it is recommended you register for another trademark including only the word or figurative elements you wish to use and protect separately.</p>

Probabilities of success for an opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>Once a trademark has been accepted by the trademarks office it will be published in the official journal for a period of three months during which interested third parties will be able to file opposition actions against the trademark applications.</p>

<p>In New Zealand, if the trademarks office does not consider that the color of your trademark is a distinctive feature, then you will be able to use it in any combination of colors. If the color is considered as a distinctive feature, then the use of the trademark will be restricted to the colors defined in the registration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In case the trademark includes words that have a meaning in any other language than English, or includes foreign characters or alphabets (Pinyin, Han, kanji, katakana, Cyrillic, Greek…) then a translation or transliteration will have to be provided with the application.</p>

<p>If the trademark includes words in Maori, or derives from a Maori word, the application will be forwarded to the Maori Trade Marks Advisory Committee in order to determine whether the trademark may be offensive to the Maori nation. Such is the case as well with any trademark that appears to be derivative of Maori text or imagery or may be deemed offensive to the Maori.</p>

<p>In general, names and representations of a person may be registered as a trademark. However, written consent from the person concerned or their legal representative may be required by the trademarks office, or evidence of the person having died at least ten years before the trademark application if it is the case.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although as stated above it is not necessary for a trademark to be in use in New Zealand in order for it to register, if it is not used periods of three consecutive years, it will become vulnerable to cancellation actions for non-use.</p>

<p>Once registered, trademark in New Zealand have a validity of ten (10) years counting from the application date. It can then be renewed indefinitely for successive periods of ten years. The renewal can be requested during the year preceding the expiration date, as well as during the year following it, upon payment of additional fees.</p>

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in Peru</h2>

<p>As Peru is a first-to-file jurisdiction, in order to be protected in that country trademarks must necessarily be registered locally. Exceptionally, in the case of famous and well-known trademarks, actions may be presented in certain circumstances of infringement even if the trademarks have not been registered in Peru.</p>

<p>Trademark registration in Peru is done through the Peruvian National Institute for the Protection of Intellectual Property (<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://www.indecopi.gob.pe/web/signos-distintivos/registro-de-marca-y-otros-signos" target="_blank" title="Peru trademarks office">INDECOPI</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you register a combined trademark (which includes both word elements and figurative elements) in Peru, the exclusive right to use the trademark is limited to a use of the trademark in the exact configuration or way in which it was filed and registered. If you wish to use the word element of your trademark separately from the logo (or vice versa), it is recommended you register for another trademark including only the word or figurative elements you wish to use and protect separately.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if a third party eventually intends to register or use a trademark for similar goods or services that includes a primary or distinct part or portion of your trademark, you will have the right to oppose the application based on confusing similarity. Probabilities of success for an opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>To oppose the registration of a trademark, the opposition must be presented within 30 business days following the publication of the trademark in the official journal of Peru.</p>

<p>Although use of a trademark is not required in order to file or register a trademark, once registered, if the trademark is not used in the marketplace in connection to the goods or services for which it was registered, cancellation actions may be presented by third parties. In order to prevent this, trademarks should be used within three (3) years from the date of registration.</p>

<p>Peru is a member state of the Andean Pact (<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="http://www.comunidadandina.org/Seccion.aspx?id=83&amp;tipo=TE&amp;title=propiedad-intelectual" target="_blank" title="Andean Pact">CAN</a>), therefore, use of a trademark in order to prevent such actions may take place in any of the other member countries (<a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademark-registration-bolivia" title="Bolivia trademark registration information">Bolivia</a>, <a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademark-registration-colombia" title="Colombia trademark registration information">Colombia</a> or <a class="wysiwyg-color-igerent" href="https://igerent.com/trademark-registration-ecuador" title="Ecuador trademark registration information">Ecuador</a>).</p>

<p>A registered trademark in Peru will have a validity period of ten (10) years from the date it is registered. It may be renewed indefinitely for subsequent ten-year terms. Renewal of a trademark may be done six (6) months prior to the mark’s expiry date. If a trademark is not renewed before its expiry date, it can still be renewed up to six (6) months after expiration by payment of extra fees.</p>

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in Philippines</h2>

<p>In order to obtain trademark rights in the Philippines, the trademark necessarily has to be registered, as it is a strictly “first-to-file” jurisdiction. Only in very special circumstances can previous use of a trademark grant some rights over it, such as well-known trademarks or when the use of the trademark dates back from before 1998.</p>

<p>Trademark applications must be filed via the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines (<a href="http://www.ipophil.gov.ph/" target="_blank" title="Philippines trademarks office">IPPHL</a>).</p>

<p>The Philippines is also a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/treaties/en/documents/pdf/madrid_marks.pdf" target="_blank" title="Madrid Member States">member state</a>&nbsp;to the Madrid Protocol. Thus, the extension of an international registration of a trademark via the Madrid System is possible for this country. For further information regarding our services for trademark filing through the Madrid System&nbsp;<a href="https://igerent.com/madrid-system-trademark-registration" target="_blank" title="Madrid trademark services">click here</a>.</p>

<p>Use of the trademark prior to filing can help overcome an objection based on grounds of lack of distinctiveness, as extensive and proven use of the trademark in the Philippines can confer it acquired distinctiveness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please note that by default your logo (device) application in the Philippines will be filed without color claim. If you wish to claim color as a distinctive feature of the trademark, please instruct us to do so.</p>

<p>If you register a combined trademark (which includes both word elements and figurative elements) in the Philippines, the exclusive right to use the trademark is limited to a use of the trademark in the exact configuration or way in which it was filed and registered. If you wish to use the word element of your trademark separately from the logo (or vice versa), it is recommended you register for another trademark including only the word or figurative elements you wish to use and protect separately.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if a third party eventually intends to register or use a trademark for similar goods or services that includes a primary or distinct part or portion of your trademark, you will have the right to oppose the application based on confusing similarity. Probabilities of success for an opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>Once a trademark has been published in the E-gazette, third parties have a timeframe of 30 days to file an opposition against the application. Two extensions of time of 30 days might be requested by an interested third party to extend the opposition period.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for the trademark to be in use for it to register. However, it will need to be in use by the time the third-year Declaration of Use is required. Various Declarations of use will have to be presented during the lifespan of a trademark in the Philippines. For further information regarding this, please see our FAQ section at the bottom of this page.</p>

<p>In the Philippines, trademarks are granted for an initial term of ten (10) years starting from the registration date. They can then be renewed from successive periods of ten years each. The renewal can be requested from six (6) months before the expiration date to six (6) months after it. If the renewal is requested after the expiration date, a late renewal penalty fee will apply. A proof of use will have to be filed along with the renewal request.</p>

<p>In Saudi Arabia, trademark registration is mandatory to be granted rights over a trademark, as it is a "first to file" jurisdiction. Only in some exceptional cases can an unregistered trademark be protected. The trademark applications must be filed with the Ministry of Commerce and Investment of Saudi Arabia (<a href="http://mci.gov.sa/en/ServicesDirectory/Pages/Services.aspx?Category=Trade%20Marks" target="_blank" title="Saudi Arabia trademarks office">MCI</a>).</p>

<p>It is not necessary for a trademark to be in use in Saudi Arabia in order for it to register.</p>

<p>If you register a combined trademark (which includes both word elements and figurative elements) in Saudi Arabia, the exclusive right to use the trademark is limited to a use of the trademark in the exact configuration or way in which it was filed and registered. If you wish to use the word element of your trademark separately from the logo (or vice versa), it is recommended you register for another trademark including only the word or figurative elements you wish to use and protect separately.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if a third party eventually intends to register or use a trademark for similar goods or services that includes a primary or distinct part or portion of your trademark, you will have the right to oppose the application based on confusing similarity.</p>

<p>Opposition actions may be filed by third parties against a trademark application within three (3) months after its publication in the trademark gazette. The probabilities of success for an opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>Although a trademark does not have to be in use in order for it to register, it must not go unused for periods of five years or it will become vulnerable to cancellation actions based on lack of use of the trademark. To prevent this vulnerability, the use must be on a commercial scale. Lack of use may be justified in certain circumstances.</p>

<p>Registered trademarks in Saudi Arabia have a validity of ten (10) Hegira years (approximately 9 years and 8 months in the Gregorian calendar) from the application date and can be renewed indefinitely for further periods of ten (10) Hegira years. The renewal can be requested within twelve (12) Hegira months before the expiration date. After this, there is a grace period of six (6) Hegira months during which the trademark can still be renewed, upon payment of a late renewal fee.</p>

<p>For trademark search reports the trademark must be in Latin alphabet and will only consider other trademarks in Latin alphabet.

Following recent changes in Saudi Arabia law, once a Power of Attorney is provided, it will be valid for five (5) years only. For this reason, if you have filed trademarks in the past or require renewal of a previously filed trademark, a new Power of Attorney document will have to be provided for Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>When a trademark is successfully registered in Saudi Arabia, a hard copy of the trademark certificate will not be issued. Only digital certificates are given by the trademark office of Saudi Arabia upon registration of a trademark.</p>

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in Thailand</h2>

<p>In Thailand, it is mandatory to register a trademark in order to obtain protection and proprietary rights for it, as Thailand is a “first-to-file” jurisdiction. However, in exceptional cases, well-known trademarks can be protected even if they have not been filed yet.</p>

<p>Trademark applications in Thailand are filed with the Department of Intellectual Property (<a href="http://www.ipthailand.go.th/en/" target="_blank" title="Thailand trademarks office">DIP</a>).</p>

<p>Trademarks do not need to be in use in Thailand in order to be filed or registered. However, extensive prior use of the mark may prove acquired distinctiveness, and as such help overcome objections raised on grounds of lack of distinctiveness.</p>

<p>Please note that in order to confer a trademark owner the right to use the trademark in any color combination the accompanied logo (device) for the application in Thailand should be in black and white. If the accompanied logo (device) is presented in color, the owner will only be conferred the right to use the trademark in the colors of the accompanied logo (device).</p>

<p>If you register a combined trademark (which includes both word elements and figurative elements) in Thailand, the exclusive right to use the trademark is limited to a use of the trademark in the exact configuration or way in which it was filed and registered. If you wish to use the word element of your trademark separately from the logo (or vice versa), it is recommended you register for another trademark including only the word or figurative elements you wish to use and protect separately.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if a third party eventually intends to register or use a trademark for similar goods or services that includes a primary or distinct part or portion of your trademark, you will have the right to oppose the application based on confusing similarity. Probabilities of success for an opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>Once a trademark has passed the examination by the trademarks office, it will be published in the Royal Gazette. Interested third parties will then have a period of 90 days during which they can file opposition actions against it, if they so wish. Opposition actions may be filed based on prior rights or absolute grounds.</p>

<p>Although use is not necessary for the trademark to register, after registration the trademark will have to be used. Cancellation actions for non-use may be presented against a trademark that has not been used during the three years preceding the filing of such an action. However, the amount of use required to prevent such vulnerability is minimal.</p>

<p>In Thailand, registered are valid for a period of ten (10) years starting from the application date, and can then be renewed indefinitely for further periods of ten years. The application for trademark renewal must be filed within the 90 days preceding the expiration date or during the grace period of six (6) months following it, upon payment of a late renewal additional fee.&nbsp;In order to renew a trademark, a new Power of Attorney will need to be provided even if the agent or attorney is the same as the one who filed the initial application. A copy of the trademark certificate must also be provided.</p>

<h2>Why and How to Register a Trademark in United Kingdom</h2>

<p>Trademark protection in the United Kingdom must be obtained by registering through the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/intellectual-property-office" target="_blank" title="Trademark Office of United Kingdom">United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office (UKIPO)</a> directly.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom is a “first-to-file” jurisdiction. The rights to a trademark are granted to the first person to file it, not the first person to use it. Exceptions to this rule exist as in the case of well known trademarks or trademarks filed in bad faith.</p>

<p>Trademark rights are only granted if the trademark is effectively registered.</p>

<p>Foreign entities and persons can be trademark owners in the United Kingdom. Foreign holders of trademarks will need to be represented by a trademark attorney or law firm of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>A registered trademark in the United Kingdom will be valid in all its territory. This includes England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT).</p>

<p><a href="https://igerent.com/trademark-registration-european-union" title="European Union trademark registration">Trademarks registered in the European Union</a> after the January 1st 2021 are no longer valid in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/eu-trademark-protection-and-comparable-uk-trademarks" target="_blank" title="Trademark protection for EU trademarks post BREXIT">Trademarks that were registered in the European Union prior to BREXIT are protected in the UK</a>. In this case the trademarks are granted a comparable trademark by the UK trademark office. The comparable trademarks are independent to the EU trademarks. Any change to this trademark will have to be processed directly through IPO UK.</p>

<h2>Trademark search United Kingdom</h2>

<p>Carrying out a trademark search in UK before proceeding is recommended. Our search services are carried out by UK trademark specialists. Our attorneys will check if there are any similar marks for the goods or services included in the trademark.</p>

<p>Our search does not only consider results that appear in the United Kingdom trademark database.</p>

<p>A trademark will be refused if it includes the image of a crown or images of members of the Royal family. Other reasons for refusal exist and will be considered by our trademark experts when conducting the trademark search.</p>

<p>Our trademark search includes a full analysis of the trademark. Trademark analysis is done in the same way it would be carried out by an examiner of the UK IPO. Our search reports also include recommendations on how to increase the chance of success for your trademark application.</p>

<p>Knowing the real chances your trademark has of being registered allows you to make better decisions. It is beneficial to know beforehand if it is worth proceeding with the trademark filing in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Having complete knowledge of the chances of registration may allow you to negotiate coexistent agreements beforehand. In some cases acquiring third parties trademarks or even rebranding may be necessary. In any case, information is crucial.</p>

<h2>Process of Registering a Trademark in UK</h2>

<p>The registration process in the United Kingdom is one of the fastest in the world. The average registration process takes approximately 3 months to complete.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is not necessary for trade marks to be used in the United Kingdom in order to file it. Use is not a requirement for a mark to be accepted and registered. Previous use of the trademark may be useful to overcome objections raised on the grounds of lack of distinctiveness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A trademark application in the United Kingdom will be examined by the Intellectual Property Office. During the examination process the office will carry out a UK IPO trademark search. Trademark objection may be received for reasons other than the existence of previous trademarks. If no objections are raised the application will be published in the <a href="https://www.ipo.gov.uk/t-tmj.htm" target="_blank" title="Trademark journal of United Kingdom">United Kingdom trademark journal</a>.</p>

<p>After a trademark is published there is a 2 month period for third parties to present opposition actions. The 2 month period for trademark opposition may be extended to 3 months.</p>

<p>Filing a trademark directly through the trademark office of the United Kingdom is not the only way to achieve trademark registration. <a href="https://igerent.com/madrid-system-trademark-registration" title="International trademark iGERENT">Registration of a trademark may also be done through the international registration system</a>. Use of the international trademark system is possible because <a href="https://www.wipo.int/madrid/en/members/" target="_blank" title="Madrid member country list">the United Kingdom is a member state to the Madrid Protocol</a>.</p>

<h2>After a trademark is registered in the United Kingdom</h2>

<p>Once the registration process is complete a trademark certificate will be issued. The trademark certificate for a trademark registration in the UK is digital.</p>

<p>Hard copies of the certificate of registration can be ordered but have additional costs.</p>

<p>If a trademark has not been used for 5 years after registration it may be subject to trademark cancellation actions.</p>

<p>A trademark is registered for an initial period of 10 years starting from the date of filing of the application. The trademark can be renewed for further periods of 10 years. The renewal request can be filed starting 6 months before the expiration date, and until 6 months after the expiration date. In case the renewal is filed after the expiration date, extra costs will apply.</p>

<p>If a trademark is not renewed before the period ending 6 months after its expiration period it will automatically lapse. If this happens in order to protect trademarks in UK new mark applications will need to be filed.</p>

Probabilities of success for an opposition will vary in each case depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>Opposition actions against the registration of a trademark may be presented. The moment to file an opposition is before the trademark is examined by the trademark office.
