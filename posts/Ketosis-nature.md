## What is ketosis?

When dietary glucose falls, liver **HMG-CoA synthase (HMGCS2)** converts fatty-acids into the ketone bodies **β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)** and acetoacetate, which readily fuel the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle.[1]

## Human ketosis levels

| Situation                          | Typical BHB range        | Notes                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Overnight fast                     | 0.1 – 0.3 mmol L⁻¹       | Baseline in healthy adults[1]                                              |
| Low-carb / ketogenic diet          | 0.5 – 3 mmol L⁻¹         | “Nutritional ketosis”; cognitive and metabolic studies target this zone[5] |
| Prolonged total fast (≥ 3 days)    | 2 – 7 mmol L⁻¹           | Peaks around day 7; brain now covers > 60 % of ATP with ketones[1]         |
| Diabetic or alcoholic ketoacidosis | 10 mmol L⁻¹ + & pH < 7.3 | Medical emergency needing prompt treatment[1]                              |

## Small hibernators: deep nutritional ketosis

Thirteen-lined ground squirrels fast ~6 months; plasma BHB rises from < 0.3 to ≈ 2–3 mmol L⁻¹, supplying more than half of brain ATP while glucose stays low.[2]

## Bears: fat burning without strong ketosis

Denning brown bears rely almost entirely on stored fat yet keep BHB below ≈ 1 mmol L⁻¹ thanks to slow metabolic rate and rapid peripheral uptake, sparing glucose without full nutritional ketosis.[3]

## Humans: why the switch persists

-   **Brain safeguard:** Ketones cover two-thirds of cerebral fuel after 48 h without food.
-   **Neonate survival:** Newborns, low on glycogen, enter mild ketosis within hours of birth.
-   **Evolutionary pull:** Most placental mammals (humans included) retain functional **HMGCS2**; only a few lineages (whales, elephants, fruit bats) have lost it, underscoring continuing selection for a famine-buffer pathway.[4]

## Children: rapid ketone production

Children transition to ketosis faster than adults. Their higher brain-to-body mass ratio (brain uses ~50% of resting energy in toddlers vs. ~20% in adults) and smaller glycogen reserves mean hepatic stores deplete within 8–12 hours of fasting—roughly half the time needed in adults. Plasma BHB can reach 1–2 mmol L⁻¹ after an overnight fast in young children, a level adults typically achieve only after 24+ hours. This metabolic flexibility has been exploited therapeutically: ketogenic diets have treated pediatric epilepsy since the 1920s, achieving seizure control in ~50–70% of cases by stabilizing neural excitability through ketone-mediated GABAergic signaling and reduced glycolytic flux.[10]

## Gestation: ketones before birth

Maternal BHB crosses the placenta within minutes, and the fetus exploits it for energy and lipid synthesis.

-   **Physiological ketonemia:** After an overnight fast, pregnant women usually remain ≤ 0.5–1.0 mmol L⁻¹ BHB.[9]
-   **Clinical thresholds:** UK and ADA guidelines flag **BHB > 1.0 mmol L⁻¹** in pregnancy for extra monitoring and recommend urgent assessment at **> 3 mmol L⁻¹** because of ketoacidosis risk.[8]
-   **Outcomes:** Persistent BHB ≥ 3 mmol L⁻¹—seen with uncontrolled diabetes, severe vomiting, starvation, or strict ketogenic diets—correlates with lower birth-weight and potential neuro-developmental deficits; obstetric teams therefore discourage deliberate long-term ketosis and track ketone levels in at-risk pregnancies.[6][7]

**Bottom line **Ketosis is an ancient, flexible backup-fuel system—helping squirrels in burrows, bears in dens, humans during fasts, and even fetuses between meals.
