## Factors That Lead to a Good Night Sleep

Unfortunately, we struggle with sleep, and factors such as stress, anxiety, and poor sleep habits can contribute to insomnia and other sleep disorders.

Here's a curated list of what I'm trying to do to improve my sleep:

## Sleep Environment

The sleep environment includes factors such as temperature, noise, light, and comfort of the bed. To create an optimal sleep environment, it is recommended to:

-   Keep the bedroom cool: A temperature of around 15-19°C (60-67°F) is ideal for sleep, as it promotes the body's natural temperature drop during the night.
-   Minimize noise: Use earplugs or white noise machines to block out noises that may disrupt your sleep, such as traffic or a snoring partner. Consider strongly **not having kids**. Cute, but noisy.
-   Keep the room dark
-   Ensure a comfortable bed

## Sleep Hygiene

Sleep hygiene refers to the habits and practices that promote good sleep. To improve sleep hygiene, it is recommended to:

-   Maintain a consistent sleep schedule: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, **even on weekends**.
-   Wind down before bedtime: Create a relaxing bedtime routine, such as taking a warm bath or reading a book, to help signal the body that it is time to sleep.
-   Avoid stimulating activities before bed: Avoid using electronic devices, watching TV, or engaging in other stimulating activities before bed, as they can interfere with sleep.
-   Limit caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine: Caffeine and nicotine are stimulants that can interfere with sleep, while alcohol may initially promote sleep but can disrupt it later in the night.

## Early Day Light Exposure

Light exposure plays a crucial role in regulating the body's circadian rhythm, which is the internal biological clock that governs the sleep-wake cycle. Exposure to bright light in the morning can help reset the circadian rhythm and improve sleep quality. To optimize light exposure for better sleep, it is recommended to:

-   Get sunlight in the morning: Exposure to natural sunlight in the morning can help reset the circadian rhythm and promote alertness during the day. Spending time outside or near a window in the morning can help regulate the sleep-wake cycle.
-   Use light therapy: Light therapy involves using a special lamp or light box to simulate natural sunlight and regulate the circadian rhythm. This can be especially helpful for people who don't have access to natural sunlight in the morning or who have difficulty regulating their sleep-wake cycle.

Research suggests that light exposure, especially in the morning, can have a significant impact on the hormones that regulate the sleep-wake cycle. Exposure to bright light in the morning can suppress the production of the hormone melatonin, which promotes sleep, and increase the production of cortisol, which promotes wakefulness and alertness during the day (1).

By optimizing light exposure, you can help regulate your circadian rhythm and promote better sleep.

## Manage Light Exposure Close to Bedtime

Light exposure can impact the body's natural sleep-wake cycle, also known as the circadian rhythm. Exposure to bright light, particularly blue light, in the evening can suppress the production of the sleep hormone melatonin, making it more difficult to fall asleep. To promote better sleep, try to limit your exposure to bright screens, such as phones and tablets, in the hours leading up to bedtime.

Tools like f.lux can be used for computers and most phones come with built-in light filtering options.

## Regular exercise

Regular exercise can help by reducing stress and anxiety, regulating the body's internal clock, and promoting physical fatigue.

-   Engage in moderate-intensity exercise: Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week, such as brisk walking, cycling, or swimming.
-   Avoid vigorous exercise close to bedtime: Vigorous exercise can stimulate the body and make it difficult to fall asleep, so it is best to finish exercising at least three hours before bedtime.

## Avoid Eating Close to Bedtime

What and when you eat can also affect your sleep quality. Eating a heavy meal close to bedtime can cause discomfort and disrupt your sleep.

-   Timing: Try to eat your last meal of the day at least two to three hours before bedtime to allow your body enough time to digest the food.
-   Beverages: Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol close to bedtime. These substances can interfere with sleep quality and make it harder to fall asleep.

Eating a balanced diet and avoiding heavy meals close to bedtime can help promote better sleep quality.

## Marijuana Consumption

Marijuana is often used for its relaxing effects, but it can also impact sleep quality. While some people may find that marijuana helps them fall asleep faster, it can lead to disrupted sleep later in the night. Additionally, frequent marijuana use can lead to dependence, tolerance, and withdrawal symptoms that can further impact sleep quality. If you use marijuana to help with sleep, talk to your healthcare provider about potential risks and alternative options.

## An Example Sleep-Optimizing Routine

-   7:00 AM: Wake up and get outside for 10-15 minutes of natural sunlight exposure. This helps regulate the circadian rhythm and promote wakefulness during the day.
-   8:00 AM: Eat a healthy breakfast that includes protein, whole grains, and healthy fats. This helps keep you satiated and energized throughout the morning.
-   12:00 PM: Take a break from work or other activities to get outside for a 10-15 minute walk or just to sit in natural sunlight. This helps regulate the circadian rhythm and promote wakefulness during the day.
-   1:00 PM: Eat a healthy lunch that includes protein, whole grains, and healthy fats. Avoid heavy or spicy foods that can cause digestive discomfort.
-   4:00 PM: Avoid caffeine and alcohol in the hours leading up to bedtime. Both can interfere with sleep quality and make it more difficult to fall asleep.
-   6:00 PM: Eat a light dinner that includes protein, vegetables, and healthy fats. Avoid heavy or spicy foods that can cause digestive discomfort.
-   8:00 PM: Begin winding down for the night by dimming the lights, taking a warm bath or shower, and engaging in relaxing activities such as reading or meditation. Avoid bright screens in the hours leading up to bedtime.
-   10:00 PM: Get into bed at a consistent time each night. Create a comfortable sleeping environment by setting the temperature to a cool but comfortable level, and reducing noise and light. Use a comfortable mattress and pillows to support the body.
-   11:00 PM: Lights out. Try to get 7-9 hours of sleep each night.
